## Project

### Name & Category
Project: ProofID Finance
Category: Identity / DeFi

### Description
Many people in the crypto space lack a secure way to prove their identity, reputation, or creditworthiness without exposing their entire personal data. ProofID Finance is a vApp that enables users to prove their reputation & eligibility (such as credit score, on-chain activity, or asset ownership) using zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) powered by the Soundness Layer.
Users can:
Prove loan eligibility without revealing their entire financial history.
Use decentralized identity (DID) that is reusable across dApps.
Access DeFi services while preserving privacy.
### SL Integration  
ZK-proof generation → users can prove claims without disclosing raw data.
On-chain proof verification → smart contracts only accept valid proofs.
Composability → proofs can be reused across multiple DeFi applications.

## Technical
Architecture
Frontend (Web dApp) → User interface for identity registration, proof generation, loan application.
Backend API → Stores metadata (non-sensitive), communicates with SL to request proofs.
Smart Contracts → Handle on-chain proof verification and provide DeFi mechanisms (lending/borrowing).
Soundness Layer → Generates & verifies cryptographic proofs.
  
### Stack
Frontend: React + Tailwind
Backend: Node.js (Express)
Blockchain: Soundness Layer + Ethereum / L2
Storage: WALRUS for identity, IPFS for encrypted documents, PostgreSQL for metadata

### Features
Decentralized Identity (DID) → Users can have an on-chain identity with private data control.
ZK Credit Proofs → Proofs that users meet loan requirements without revealing all financial details.
Private DeFi Access → Lending/borrowing based on proofs instead of traditional KYC.

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
Basic identity registry smart contract
Soundness Layer integration for simple proofs
Simple UI for identity registration

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
Implement ZK credit proofs
Lending/borrowing smart contracts connected with proofs
Production-ready dApp + user testing

## Innovation
Privacy + Trust: Users can prove reputation without exposing raw personal data.
Interoperable: Proofs generated with SL can be reused across DeFi protocols.
Inclusive Finance: Opens financial access for users who would normally fail traditional KYC.
